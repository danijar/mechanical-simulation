Mechanical Simulation
=====================

This is our [repository](https://github.com/danijar/mechanical-simulation) on
Github.

Project idea
------------

Build a physics enabled simulation for mechanical designs like robots on the
interactive floor. Designs can be loaded as 3D model. You can apply forces
to it and control time, for example slow it down or freeze it. Situations that
are hard to reproduce, can be saved as blue prints and automated tests can be
run every time you change your robot design.
